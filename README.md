# Automatic_Dictation
Dictate your dictation of GRE Words

# Instructions on how to use the program:

1. Download Python3 (search it on google)

2. decompress the folder so that it becomes a directory

2. Go to and enter the word_selection directory in command prompt / terminal

3. Run the following command
	
	python3 select.py

# P.S.: 

You can add more words into word.txt by putting one word in each line and following the format in the file (i.e. english : chinese). Deduplication is automatically performed (if you input new definitions for a word on the bottom of the file, new definitions would be applied).

If you want to recite words in a file other than word.txt (for instance a.txt), just change the "word.txt" in the 4th line of select.py to "a.txt"
